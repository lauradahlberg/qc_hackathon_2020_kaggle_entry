## Team's Code Submission* to the 2020 Queen City Hackathon - Kaggle track





### Background:
---
City planners need to leveraget socio-economic data of certain geographical areas, in order to make best possible decisions for the city, on choose the areas to spend money on development.

The objective is to accurately predict the target variable - which is a blended metric quantifying growth/decline in the economic health of an area over the last decade.




### Datasets:
---
● training.csv: contains aggregate economic indicator data (416 rows, 496 columns), including the target variable. This data is to be used for training a machine learning model to predict the target. 
● testing.csv: contains aggregate economic indicator data (45 rows, 495 columns), ​does not​ include the target. This data is to be used for generating predictions that will be evaluated for accuracy. 
● data description.csv: data dictionary containing information about the columns. 




### Judging Criteria:
---
The models will be evaluated using a weighted MSE metric.  These errors will be weighted by the column ‘Population _2018’







* I will continue posting edits of the code to practice and improve the models
